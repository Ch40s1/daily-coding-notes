# daily-coding-notes
This project will be a blog to keep track of my learning. I want to keep track of common ways to solve dsa questions by having a place to save my pseudocode.
I will be basing my notes form the internet and things that I read on courses, so things may not be accurate.
My goal is to make a website with my understaing of things. I will be wrong, it will look and not function correctly, so use at your own risk.

## Documentation
In the fututre I will organize everything and have proper docs
