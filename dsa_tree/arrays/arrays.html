    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      We are going to slowly build up our knowledge of arrays. We will start with the basics and then move on to more complex topics.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h2>Creating an array</h2>
      <p>
        Something to note is that arrays are 0-indexed. This means that the first element in an array is at index 0.
        Creating one is simple in python. Here is an example:
      </p>
      <code>
        arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Accessing elements</h2>
      <p>
        To access an element in an array, you can use the index of the element. Here is an example:
      </p>
      <code>
        arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print(arr[0]) # This will print 1
      </code>
  </main>
