    <h1>Big O</h1>
    <p>
      Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size grows. It is a way to describe the worst case scenario of an algorithm. It is a way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm.

      <h2>Constant time</h2>
      <p>
        An algorithm is said to run in constant time if the runtime of the algorithm does not change as the input size grows. This is denoted by O(1).
      </p>
      <code>
        def constant_time(arr):
          return arr[0]
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Linear time</h2>
      <p>
        An algorithm is said to run in linear time if the runtime of the algorithm grows linearly as the input size grows. This is denoted by O(n).
      </p>
      <code>
        def linear_time(arr):
          for i in arr:
            print(i)
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Quadratic time</h2>
      <p>
        An algorithm is said to run in quadratic time if the runtime of the algorithm grows quadratically as the input size grows. This is denoted by O(n^2).
      </p>
      <code>
        def quadratic_time(arr):
          for i in arr:
            for j in arr:
              print(i, j)
      </code>
