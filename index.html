    <h1>Welcome to DSA_daily</h1>
    <p>
      I made this website to keep track of data structures and algorithms while also
      learning web development. I hope you find it useful!

    <p>
      I myself am learning dsa and web development so I will be updating this website as I learn more.
      Since I am learning web development, the website might not look the best but I will try my best to make it look good.
      Also, I am learning dsa so the information might not be 100% accurate but I will try my best to make it as accurate as possible.
